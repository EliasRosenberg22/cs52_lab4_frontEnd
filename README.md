# Title

First app combining react and redux. Redux is kind of a pain, ngl. 
I credit a lot of my code to this tutorial. This man saved me because I couldn't figure out how to connect anything, and without curl, I had no idea how to check my store until I had axios stuff working. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93p3LxR9xfM&t=1230s

## What Worked Well
Literally nothing. This lab started out with a bad omen: I couldn't get curl requests to work. My GET request went through fine, but the POST didn't!?!?! How the hell does that work when they use the same url?? Implementing Redux was really rough, and doesn't make intuitive sense. Lots of things are props, but not really. They're not passed as clearly as they were in React which through me off for every single componenet. Files feel so distant, it's hard to know what's coming from what and what is where and what it's called and ughghghgghghghghg.
